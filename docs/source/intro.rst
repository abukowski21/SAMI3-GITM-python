Introduction
============

``SAMI3-GITM-Python`` provides python scripts to allow easy manipulation of SAMI3 and GITM model outputs. In theory, new models can be added quite easily... 

In addition to the post-processing of model outputs, some basic plotting scripts have been provided, though more complicated plotting is left to the user. 

This package has no plans be ported to a standalone python package. If you wish to use anything in this project in your own python scripts, add the package to your `$PATH` (see usage for more info).


I've done my best to capture as many use-cases as possible. Please fill out an `Issue <https://github.com/abukowski21/SAMI3-GITM-python/issues>`_ if you notice any problems.




A huge thank you goes out to the developers of `SAMI3 <10.5281/zenodo.7895859>`_ and `GITM <https://github.com/GITMCode/GITM/>`_. Without their hard work, this project would not be possible.
