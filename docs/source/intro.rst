Introduction
============

``SAMI3-GITM-Python`` provides python scripts to allow easy manipulation of SAMI3 and GITM model outputs. In theory, new models can be added quite easily... 

In addition to the post-processing of model outputs, some basic plotting scripts have been provided, though more complicated plotting is left to the user. 

This package has no plans be ported to a standalone python package. If you wish to use anything in this project in your own python scripts, add the package to your `$PATH` (see usage for more info).


I've done my best to capture as many use-cases as possible. Please fill out an `Issue <https://github.com/abukowski21/SAMI3-GITM-python/issues>`_ if you notice any problems.

Note, I am finalizing my dissertation right now. A lot of these features are half-baked but the framework is there. I'm updating the code and documentation as I go, but free time is a little limited right now. Please reach out if you spot gaps or errors in the documentation or an aspect of the code is not working. Either email me or fill out a GitHub issue and I can prioritize it. 


A huge thank you goes out to the developers of SAMI3 and GITM. Without their hard work, this project would not be possible. SAMI3 can be found `here <https://zenodo.org/record/7895859>`_ and is originally published in `this paper <https://doi.org/10.1029/2008GL033509>`_. Here is the link to `GITM <https://github.com/GITMCode/GITM/>`_ which was originally published in `this paper <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jastp.2006.01.008>`_.
