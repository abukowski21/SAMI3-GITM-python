# SAMI3-GITM-Python

A collection of Python scripts for reading and plotting both SAMI3 and GITM results.

SAMI3 has been modified to accept GITM neutral atmosphere data, but the code should work for any SAMI3 or GITM run.


All work is being done on the `develop` branch. Here's how to get to it:

`git clone` the repository

`cd` into it

`git checkout develop`
