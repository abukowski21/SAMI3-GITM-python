# SAMI3-GITM-python

Here is all the current work being done. See the main branch for info on what needs to be done.


## Please feel free to make any changes you would like!!


Scripts are available for both SAMI3 and GITM data analysis. 
SAMI3 data needs to be post-processed before it can be manipulated with these programs. 
> (See utility_programs for information.)

SAMI3 data can be processed further using InterpSAMI3toGrid.ipynb, allowing it to be plot 
with grographic coordinate systems.
