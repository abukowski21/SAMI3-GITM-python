# Sami3GitmSimStorm

Code for analyzing SAMI3 and GITM results.

SAMI3 has been modified to accept GITM neutral atmosphere data, but the code should work for any SAMI3 or GITM run.


All work is being done on the `develop` branch. Here's how to get to it:

`git clone https://github.com/abukowski21/Sami3GitmSimStorm`

`cd Sami3GitmSimStorm`

`git checkout develop`

Feel free to fork this, make changes you like to the existing files & functions, or make you own stuff! Some ideas on changes that need to be made:




## TODO:
- Turn the GITM & SAMI plotting routines into regular python scripts that can be imported into another script. (read data automatically, return data in a nice way, etc.)
- Make more plot types
- Handle satellite outputs
- Make things a little more user-friendly, or document things a bit better.
