    "I've spent a ton of time developing a softwarte stack to deal with the model outputs. Most of the regridding options can be called with the postprocessmodelresults.py program. From the command line you can see what the options are with `python PostprocessModelResults.py -h`\n",

    "### Option 1:\n",
    "If your jupyter notebook is in the root directory of this package, you can just run the code below:\n",
